# my-first-chatbot
hey there !
this is just an experimental project made at the end of my 2nd year of engineering.

things you'll need to set this up:
 - python 3.x
 - nltk
 - tensorFlow
 - basic flask/html/css/javascript templates for constructing the front end of the chatbot :)

here are few screenshots of the working machine!

# ü§ñ AI-Based FAQ Chatbot  

## üìå Project Overview  
The **AI-Based FAQ Chatbot** is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)-powered chatbot** designed to automate responses to frequently asked **banking-related queries**, such as **credit card eligibility, transaction security, and account fees**.  

This chatbot leverages **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)** techniques to understand user intent and provide **real-time, accurate answers**. It was developed as part of my research at **Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR)** to enhance automated customer support.

## üöÄ Key Features  
‚úî **AI-powered intent classification** for dynamic responses  
‚úî **92% accuracy** in understanding user queries  
‚úî **Supports context-aware multi-turn conversations**  
‚úî **Scalable framework** for different domains (e-commerce, customer service)  
‚úî **Pre-trained model using TensorFlow and NLP techniques**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

| **Technology** | **Usage** |
|--------------|----------|
| Python | Core programming language |
| NLTK & Scikit-learn | NLP preprocessing |
| TensorFlow | Deep Learning for intent recognition |
| Flask | API and web deployment |
| Cosine Similarity | Query matching (NLP-based approach) |
| Word2Vec | Word embeddings for improved context understanding |

# üìñ How It Works

## Step 1: User Inputs a Query  
- Example: **"What are the eligibility criteria for a credit card?"**  

## Step 2: NLP-Based Query Processing  
- The chatbot applies **Tokenization, Stopword Removal, and Word Embeddings** to preprocess the query.  
- The query is matched to predefined intents using **TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Deep Learning classifiers**.  

## Step 3: AI-Powered Response Generation  
- If the **confidence score is high**, the chatbot returns a **direct response**.  
- If the **confidence score is low**, it asks for **clarification** or suggests **related questions**.  

## Step 4: Dynamic Learning & Feedback Mechanism  
- The chatbot **retrains periodically** with new user queries to improve **response accuracy** over time.

# üèÜ Performance & Accuracy  

| **Model**                     | **Accuracy (%)** | **Remarks**                           |
|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity     | 68%            | Struggled with query variations  |
| Deep Learning (NN Classifier)  | 92%            | More context-aware and scalable  |
